Goal : Given text for Questions , predict tags associated with them 

Suggested Guidelines : 

1. Pick top 10 most occurring tags and filter data for them and build your model for them 

2. You can expand your model later on 

3. Since there is no performance threshold and associated data given to you , you'll need to separate data in train/validation yourself 

4. Before directly jumping in with LSTM ( or any other model of your choice ) , explore this text data and see if any basic data cleaning is required .

5. Usage of Answers.csv is optional 

6. This is a multi class - multilabel prediction problem , keep that in mind 

7. Your end solution needs to be uploaded on GitHub repo
